UCI HAR Dataset
Variables Used:
"Subjects" :  Each subject in trial was giving a number 1-30, 				these numbers were used to anonymously identify 				which Subject each statistic came from.
"Activity":  Describes what the Suject was doing with the 					measurement taken.  There are six levels to 				choose from:  "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", 				"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "STANDING", "SITTING" and 				"LAYING".
Directly copied from raw data features_info.txt a description of variables is as follows:

"The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors."

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'"  from originating website:
